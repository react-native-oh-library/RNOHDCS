Cheerio has a new website, and it's looking pretty good! This has been in the
works for a while, and we're excited to finally share it with you. Let's walk
through all that's new.

:::note

Cheerio's website is still a work-in-progress, and covers Cheerio's next release
that isn't available yet.

## Guides

The Cheerio website now features a set of guides, helping you get started with
the project. Even if you've used the project for a while, you might still learn
something new!

Most of these guides were written with the help of
[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), which made it possible to generate
high-quality content in a reasonable amount of time. While contents have been
checked for accuracy, we are happy to accept pull requests to improve the
guides.

Get started with the [intro guide](/docs/intro).

## API Docs

API docs, the old focus of the website, have been moved to a subdirectory. They
are available at [docs/api](/docs/api).

## Blog

We're also starting a blog, where we'll share updates about the project. Feel
free to subscribe [to the RSS feed](/blog/rss.xml)!
